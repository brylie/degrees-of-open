# Degrees of Open

Openness, and freedom, are inherently fuzzy concepts, under active evolution. While the words **free** and **open** might not have clear definitions, in the context of culture and society, there are some clear examples of **freedom** and **openness**. This book is intended as an overview of common patterns related to freedom and openness, with particular emphasis on business and technology.
