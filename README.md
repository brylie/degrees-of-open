# Degrees of Open

Openness, and freedom, are inherently fuzzy concepts, under active evolution. While the words **free** and **open** might not have clear definitions, in the context of culture and society, there are some clear examples of **freedom** and **openness**.

This book is intended as an overview of common patterns related to freedom and openness, with particular emphasis on business and technology. Hopefully, it will serve as a roadmap along your journey to openness.

## Openness is a continuum {#openness-continuum}

Often, people/companies start by embracing openness \(e.g. open source\) out of convenience, or for other pragmatic reasons. By viewing openness as a continuum, we realize it is possible to extend the practice of openness from inward to outward. We can eventually "turn over the keys to the community" or even let go entirely.
