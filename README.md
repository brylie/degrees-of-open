# Degrees of Open

## "Open for business."

People can use your product - possibly with 'free tier'. Open for business is similar to 'come in'. It is welcoming and friendly, but does not imply any other access or rights.

## Use some open source

Product or infrastructure includes open source components.

Companies might quickly realize the benefit of using open source components. It saves them time and money.

When companies adopt open source, it also benefits the community. Benefits come in the form of a network effect, where the community grows. It is also an early step towards contribution.

## API

Some data/functionality is accessible via API

An 'open api' implies that some of the product data or logic is exposed to the public. There may be a layer of authentication, for various reasons. The bulk of the 'business value' is still closed, or controlled, by the API owner.

## SDK

Some features can be integrated into other tools via SDK

A standard developer kit (SDK) is a bit of code that interfaces with a larger system. The SDK acts as series of levers that can be used to integrate with another system. The SDK does not provide the main funcitonality, since it is just an interface, any more than a steering wheel and clutch provides a car. Offering an open source SDK means that developers can build on your larger system, but is not a substantive commitment or contribution to openness.

Some examples of SDKs:
- a company with a proprietery database platform might offer developers an SDK to use their database as a service
- a company with cloud based computation resources might give developers an SDK to create and consume the cloud service
