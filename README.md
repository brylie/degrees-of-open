# Degrees of Open

## "Open for business."

People can use your product - possibly with 'free tier'. Open for business is similar to 'come in'. It is welcoming and friendly, but does not imply any other access or rights.

## Use some open source

Product or infrastructure includes open source components.

Companies might quickly realize the benefit of using open source components. It saves them time and money.

When companies adopt open source, it also benefits the community. Benefits come in the form of a network effect, where the community grows. It is also an early step towards contribution.
