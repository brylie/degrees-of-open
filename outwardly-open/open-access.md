# Open Access

Open Access can imply a spectrum of privileges. The phrase "Open Access" is often used in scientific or educational[^1] contexts to imply that a given resource is widely accessible.

As a minimum, an Open Access resource should be publicly accessible, and possibly require a user registration to participate. For example the Open Educational Resources often require that people can access the learning materials without 'unnecessary technological encumbrance'. This means that nothing should block a person from freely accessing a resource, other than minimum technical requirements such as Internet access. This same line of reasoning applies to Open Access journals, such as the Public Library of Science.
