# Open Source

Offering sourcecode means that the public benefits from some software solution that performs a specific task. Having access source code means that people can learn how the software works. There are additional freedoms that can be granted along with source code access. Those freedoms are usually granted in the form of a software license.

Having access to source, such as software or statistical algorithms, is becoming increasingly important. Computer code is becoming a larger part of our lives on a daily basis. Code is in our vehicles, our bodies, and our governmental decision making processes.
