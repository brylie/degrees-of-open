# Open Source
> The code regulates. It implements values, or not. It enables freedoms, or disables them. It protects privacy, or promotes monitoring. People choose how the code does these things. People write the code.

Offering sourcecode means that the public benefits from some software solution that performs a specific task. Having access source code means that people can learn how the software works. There are additional freedoms that can be granted along with source code access. Those freedoms are usually granted in the form of a software license.

Having access to source, such as software or statistical algorithms, is becoming increasingly important. Computer code is becoming a larger part of our lives on a daily basis. Code is in our vehicles, our bodies, and our governmental decision making processes.

## License
In order for people to freely use code, the code must be provided with explicit terms, removing implicit Copyright restrictions. The terms of use, called license, can be rather complicated to write, so it is advisable to adopt an existing Open Source/Free Software license.

The licenses fall in to several categories:

* Non-OSI approved license
  * E.g. custom license terms similar to open source
* OSI Approved license
  * MIT, BSD, MPL, Apache, etc
* Strong copyleft license
  * E.g. GPL/AGPL

## Features

* Not all features open source
  * E.g. 'Enterprise version', 'Pro version'
* 100% features are open source
