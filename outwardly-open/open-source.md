# Open Source

> The code regulates. It implements values, or not. It enables freedoms, or disables them. It protects privacy, or promotes monitoring. People choose how the code does these things. People write the code.

Offering sourcecode means that the public benefits from some software solution that performs a specific task. Having access source code means that people can learn how the software works. There are additional freedoms that can be granted along with source code access. Those freedoms are usually granted in the form of a software license.

Having access to source, such as software or statistical algorithms, is becoming increasingly important. Computer code is becoming a larger part of our lives on a daily basis. Code is in our vehicles, our bodies, and our governmental decision making processes.

## License

> Project/organization resources are licensed to remove Copyright impediments

In order for people to freely use code, the code must be provided with explicit terms, removing implicit Copyright restrictions. The terms of use, called license, can be rather complicated to write, so it is advisable to adopt an existing Open Source/Free Software license.

The licenses fall in to several categories:

### Non-OSI approved license

Some projects are released under custom license terms similar to open source. This is not advisable, as it leads to 'license proliferation'. It may also lead to unintentional or intentional incompatibilies between projects.

### Certified licenses

The Open Source initiative and Free Software Foundation maintain lists of common, certified licenses. It is advisable to simply adopt an existing license from either or both of the [OSI Approved](https://opensource.org/licenses) or [FSF certified](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html) licenses lists, such as:

* MIT
* BS
* MPL
* Apache

### Strong copyleft license

Among the OSI and FSF approved licenses, a few offer stronger protections. These licenses, while sometimes controvertial are intended to preserve access to source code for people, in a similar way to how public parks and natural lands are preserved for the common good. These licenses include:

* GNU GPL
* GNU AGPL

## Features

> Most or, preferably, all of the software features are available under an open-source license

In addition to license terms, it is important to define what components, or features, of the project are freely available. There are at least a couple of common approaches:

* Not all features open source
  * E.g. 'Enterprise version', 'Pro version'
* 100% features are open source
