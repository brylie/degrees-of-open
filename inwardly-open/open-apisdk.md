********# Open for developers

Businesses and projects can create openings for software developers to interact with their software.

## API

> Some data/functionality is accessible via API

An 'open api' implies that some of the product data or functionality is exposed to the public. There may be a layer of authentication, for various reasons. The bulk of the 'business value' is still closed, or controlled, by the API owner.

## SDK

> Some features can be integrated into other tools via SDK

A standard developer kit \(SDK\) is a bit of code that interfaces with a larger system. The SDK acts as series of levers that can be used to integrate with another system. The SDK does not provide the main funcitonality, since it is just an interface, any more than a steering wheel and clutch provides a car. Offering an open source SDK means that developers can build on your larger system.

Some examples of SDKs:

* a company with a proprietery database platform might offer developers an SDK to use their database as a service
* a company with cloud based computation resources might give developers an SDK to create and consume the cloud service
