# "Open for business."

> People are welcome to access the business or product.

Businesses often use the word **open** to say "come in, we're open". In effect this is a welcome, or invitation to enter. In practice, being "open for business" means people can use your product - possibly with 'free tier'.

Being "open for business" does not imply any other access permissions or rights, but is a first step in community involvement.
