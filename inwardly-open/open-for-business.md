## "Open for business."

Businesses often use the word **open** to say "come in, we're open". In effect this is a welcome, or invitation to enter. In practice, being "open for business" means people can use your product - possibly with 'free tier'. 

Being "open for business" does not imply any other access permissions or rights.
