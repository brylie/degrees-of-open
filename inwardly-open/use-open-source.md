# Use some open source

> Product or infrastructure includes open source components.

Companies might quickly realize the benefit of using open source components. This could include adopting large scale projects like web servers or even smaller libraries that provide specific capabilities. By building on existing resources, companies save time and money.

When companies adopt open source, it also benefits the community. Benefits come in the form of a network effect, where the community grows. 

Adopting open-source can be an early step towards contribution.
