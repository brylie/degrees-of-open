# Open Governance

Open Governance means that stakeholders are free to participate in the decision- making process for a shared project or resource. In practice, this may come in the form of a shared roadmap or some more formal process such as voting.

## Membership

Membership requirements may be introduced in a governance process. This gives stakeholders a means to determine eligibility requirements for participants, such as a minimum level of activity or contribution required to retain decisition making rights.

## Stakeholder involvement

Members and stakeholders can participate in decision making \(voting power\) process. This means including stakeholders in regular meetings or communications, with advance notification where possible.

## Independence

It is important that stakeholds are free to work independently from the main group. They can form working groups relevant to their needs or expertise. If desired, stakeholder groups can work completely intependently of the primary organization, forming their own initiative.

## Federation

Federation allows contributors to govern the project as a loose consortium, and even define their own smaller groups. Federation is a means to balance the power of the larger body with the autonomy of smaller collectives or affinity groups. Federated groups tend to work together to a certain extent, sharing knowledge and resources.
