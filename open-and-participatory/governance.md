# Open Governance

Open Governance means that stakeholders are free to participate in the decision- making process for a shared project or resource. In practice, this may come in the form of a shared roadmap or some more formal process such as voting.

## Membership

Membership requirements may be introduced in a governance process. This gives stakeholders a means to determine eligibility requirements for participants, such as a minimum level of activity or contribution required to retain decisition making rights.

## Stakeholder involvement

Members and stakeholders can participate in decision making \(voting power\) process. This means including stakeholders in regular meetings or communications, with advance notification where possible.

## Independence

It is also important that stakeholds are free to work independently from the main group.

## Federation

Federation allows contributors to govern the project as a loose consortium, and even define their own smaller groups. Federation is a means to balance the power of the larger body with the autonomy of smaller collectives or affinity groups.
