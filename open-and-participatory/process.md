## Open process

Open Process encompasses many parts of **project management** and **governance** \(see [Governance](/open-and-participatory/governance.md) section\). In terms of project/resource management, following an open process means that all design, communication, and development artefacts are pubicly accessible to the community.

## Design

The design process covers conceptual and aesthetic decisions related to a project. Design artefacts include **wireframes**, **styleguide**, **mock-ups**, **user stories**, and **user interviews** \(usually preserving anonyminity\).

Design artefacts may prove useful to other projects, so re-use, transformation, and sharing would ideally be allowed.

## Planning

Projects and organizations must make plans to succeed. In an open process, the plans, on both large and small timescales, are visible to the community. This might include short-term plans like a sprint backlog or long-term plans including a project roadmap.

## Documentation

Part of running a project or organization is to come to agreements or promote understanding. Documentation serves as a record of decisions, concepts, and other issues. Documentation is also important for historical purposes, and so may include meeting minutes and other reference materials.
