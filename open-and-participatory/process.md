# Open process

Open Process encompasses many parts of **project management** and **governance** \(see [Governance](/open-and-participatory/governance.md) section\). In terms of project/resource management, following an open process means that all design, communication, and development artefacts are pubicly accessible to the community.

## Design

The design process covers conceptual and aesthetic decisions related to a project. Design artefacts include **wireframes**, **styleguide**, **mock-ups**, **user stories**, and **user interviews** \(usually preserving anonyminity\).

Design artefacts may prove useful to other projects, so re-use, transformation, and sharing would ideally be allowed.
