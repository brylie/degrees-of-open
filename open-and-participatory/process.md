## Open process

Open Process encompasses many parts of **project management** and **governance** \(see [Governance](/open-and-participatory/governance.md) section\). In terms of project/resource management, following an open process means that all design, communication, and development artifacts are publicly accessible to the community.

## Design

> Aretefacts related to planning and designing the project are openly available

The design process covers conceptual and aesthetic decisions related to a project. Design artefacts include **wireframes**, **styleguide**, **mock-ups**, **user stories**, and **user interviews** \(usually preserving anonyminity\).

Design artefacts may prove useful to other projects, so re-use, transformation, and sharing would ideally be allowed.

## Planning

> Project/organization plans are publicly accessible, with the possibility to participate in the planning process

Projects and organizations must make plans to succeed. In an open process, the plans, on both large and small timescales, are visible to the community. This might include short-term plans like a sprint backlog or long-term plans including a project roadmap.

## Documentation

> Project/organization documents are publicly accessible, such as meeting minutes and research documents

Part of running a project or organization is to come to agreements or promote understanding. Documentation serves as a record of decisions, concepts, and other issues. Documentation is also important for historical purposes, and so may include meeting minutes and other reference materials.
