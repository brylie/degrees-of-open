> Community can congregate around your brand, suport one another, and share experiences

Community thrives through regular contact and sharing. In order to build a successful community, it is important to provide dedicated spaces for interaction. Some types of interaction, or conversation, happen 'here and now', while others take place over time. It is important to support both **real-time** and **asynchronous** forms of sharing and communication, so that time is not a barrier to participation.
