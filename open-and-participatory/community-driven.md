# Community

## Community portal

> Community can congregate around your brand, suport one another, and share experiences

Community thrives through regular contact and sharing. In order to build a successful community, it is important to provide dedicated spaces for interaction. Some types of interaction, or conversation, happen 'here and now', while others take place over time. It is important to support both **real-time** and **asynchronous** forms of sharing and communication, so that time is not a barrier to participation.

## Ideas and feedback

> Provide a process to describe, clarify, improve, and prioritize ideas

Ideas are not formed in a vacuum. It is important to develop ideas through feedback and communication. That way, the burden is shared among the community, and our ideas can reach a more full potential than if developed in isolation.

## Pull requests welcome
