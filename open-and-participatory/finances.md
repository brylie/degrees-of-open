# Open Finances

Money is necessary to sustain projects and organizations. We want to ensure that our work is successful, so need to generate income to continue our work.

In order to support the values of **accountability** and **transparency** we can work to provide information about financial activity. This helps to ensure that the project is on a stable footing as well as encouraging **equality** between funding sources and other community stakeholders.

We can see examples of financial transparency from collectives[^1], social profit organizations[^3], and traditional private organizations. These organizations can provide financial records such as profit/loss, cash flow, backers, and more[^2].
